* "Intellectual shelf life is often more insidious than is physical shelf life."
* "Only an expert in the field of application can know if what you have failed to include is vital to the accuracy of the simulation or if it can safely be ignored."
* "When the simulation has a great deal of *stability* ... then a simulation is quite feasible."
* "Volume output seems to me to be a poor substitute for acquiring an intimate feeling for the situation being simulated."
* "Doing simple simulations at early stages lets you get *insights*" into the whole system which would be disguised in an full-scale simulation. *I strongly advise, when possible to start with the simple simulation and evolve it to a more complete, more accurate, simulation later so the insights can arise early*
* An *active mind* can contribute to a simulation even when you are dealing with experts in a field where you are a strict amateur.
* JARGON... Be still my heart <3 Hamming and I are on the same page about this.
