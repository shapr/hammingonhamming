Simulations:
* Necessary because they're so much cheatper than real experiments
* But easy to build them such that they give incorrect output
* You can't build an accurate simulation without expert knowledge in the field of application
* What does he mean about "cast the simulation in the corresponding form" ?
  Does that mean the computational structure of the simulation should match the easiest way to calculate the problem?
* Is simulation instability a function of the problem, or the simulation?
  From the weather example, it sounds like the problems aren't stable
  How can I tell if a problem will be easy to simulate?
* I agree with Hamming's idea that you need to work on a simpler version of the real problem to build intuition/insight.
  Otherwise you can waste a zillion cycles doing work that isn't useful, or isn't needed once you have a better understanding of the basics.
