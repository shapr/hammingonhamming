* "Material for glass is widely available and not likely to ever be in short supply" -- unfortunately not true - sand crisis
* Technician accomplishment vs lab experts - how much of our "potential advancement" is coming from lab based studies rather than practical ones?
* Hamming broke down the system steps -- watching things from afar
* "Every new field which arises in your future will present you with similar questions, and you will effectively answer by your later actions"
* Did Hamming's predictions come to pass? Are we using soliton signalling rather than pulses?
* "Your anticipation means you are far, far better prepared to absorb the new things when they arise than if you sit passively by and merely follow progress - Luck favors the prepared mind"
* Emphasis on what can be done economically doesn't meant that it will be done due to other considerations (legal, social)
