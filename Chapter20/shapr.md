# Simulation III
* frequencies of the trajectory? what?
* do different pilots feel different things? That's a really interesting question!
* garbage in is not always garbage out: when simulating 'shells' for nuclear reactions, any local error was averaged out over its history.
  I don't quite get this, sounds important but I don't see how I could apply it.
  * Do the inaccurate numbers go through a feedback situation where their errors will be compensated for?
  * or are they vitally out in the open with no feedback protection?
* Hamming points out that simulations are done after accidents now. I wish this would become part of software development!
