# Chapter 7

* From large organizations new effects can arise. Inflection points exist where the whole thing changes. First person shooters weren't possible on a calculator, what's the next big new effect?
* AI as humans and computers working together, that's the kind of AI I want!
* Is the programming we do coal mining or careful analysis and specification?
* Can most people be trained to higher level jobs?
* Friend of mine has a Lab Tech master's degree, says she has one of last as it's going entirely automated.
* Hm, any program that can analyse an integrated circuit clearly has some form of AI
* What does insight mean? Good patterns for effectively programming yourself?
* Hamming said perhaps AI would be solved by "volume of computation" and that certainly seems true.

# Chapter 8

* I'm still not clear on the difference between logical and pyschological novelty.
* Consider thinking may be *the way* something is done, rather than *what* is done.
  I almost understand this, maybe?
* I think the future application of computers to my area of expertise is better compilers that only need a clear specification of behavior, and produce the desired program.
  Languages should be higher level, further from the machine!
