# Chapter 7

*From large organizations new effects can arise*
System thinking - how can we/can we predict effects from assemblies of assemblies? Issues of scale in understanding behavior.

*The existence of the program automatically turns you against believing it is other than a rote process*
In reality, how much of my job is other than a rote process? I use prescriptive codified methods to come up with a solution based on a series of variables that *I* weigh.

*This is the type of AI I am interested in -- what can the human and machine do together, and not in the competition that arises*
This gets at the heart of my skepticism when AI "experts" in my field and otherwise say that it is coming for my job. It's been 25 years since this book was written and I'm seeing more potential for augmentation than replacement. He focuses on the medical field, but it applies to mine as well. Every piece of software I use to design a building absconds itself from any responsibility for the results it produces (This is also why the software game is the best option for making a lot of money in structural engineering)

- Do you think Hamming would have supported Universal Basic Income?

- Again Hamming returns to the point that the machine should be designed to do a similar process but not identical (mobile Navy robots). Underscores the importance of defining what is the equivalent task, not the identical one (different constraints, parameters, etc.)

*Is logical novelty actually possible?* 

# Chapter 8

*Often humans can cooperate with a machine far better than with other humans*

*It is difficult to get people to look at machines as good things to use whenever they will work*

*It is hard to get people to aggressively think about how things in their own area might be done differently*
This is the understatement of the century. Never underestimate the laziness of reliance on engrained knowledge in a field.
