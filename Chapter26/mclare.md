* This chapter is probably going to make me ragey
* "In an argument between an specialist and a generalist, the expert usually wins by simply (1) using unintelligible jargon, and (2) citing their specialist results, which are often completely irrelevant to the discussion" - RAGE
* "Paradigm shift" is one of the phrases I hated the most in research. Not everything is world changing. 
* "The record of the experts saying somthying is impossible just before it is done is amazing" 
* "If an expert says something can be done he is probably correct, but if he says it is impossible then consider getting another opinion"
