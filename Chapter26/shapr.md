# Experts
* A necessary evil -- Hamming
* progress comes when a field stops ignoring contradictions
* All impossibility proofs must rest on a number of assumptions which may or may not apply in the particular situation.
* If an expert says something can be done, he's probably right, if he says it is impossible, consider getting another opinion.
* using tools the clients are familiar with gives them insight and allows them to find new ways to use the solution you created
1. you will have to deal with many experts, should understand their characteristics
2. in time many of you will be experts, try not to be such a block on progress
3. rate of change is increasing, you will have to endure more changes than I did
4. if I knew the right things to say to you, paradigm changes will leave fewer of you behind in your careers
* most great innovations come from *outside* the field, archaeology got carbon dating from physics!
* first automatic telephone came from an undertaker
* There are a large number of genuine crackpots with crazy ideas, but among them there may be the crackpot with the new innovative idea!
* I will give my opinion when asked, but I do not want to be the kind of drag on the next generation I had to put up with from the past generation. Modesty? No, pride! -- Hamming
* you must keep up, or else things will overtake you and may spoil your memories of your career (Shae needs to learn kubernetes, quantum computer, blockchain, machine learning)
