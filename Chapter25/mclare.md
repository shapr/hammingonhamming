# Creativity
* "Originality" seems to be more than not having been done before 
* Where does motivation fall in creativity? Is something more creative or less creative based on the motivations for creating? 
* Excellent point about how creativity must not be tied to how many people appreciate it to have value 
* Again the theme of knowledge being lost and rediscovered once several other people find it 
* Idea of "psychological distance" being what counts most.... adding to the perception of "difficulty" 
* Idea of time: "a long gestation period" being critical to the creative process... definitely something I've found in practice 
* "You now know how not to do it!" -- too bad you can't write that up and publish it! 
* fundamental vs. frills - what is practical? or can that be too constricting to keep coming back to the big picture
* Dropping a problem... how do you distinguish between a dead end and the needed "long gestation period"?
