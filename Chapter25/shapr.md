# Creativity
* not valued in primitive societies (Shae is not sure that's changed)
* creativity + value? (to whom?)
* Continental drift first published in 1838, but credit to post WW2 people
* Shae is hearing "The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed." -- William Gibson
* I suspect novel and creative ideas are rediscovered all the time, but aren't disseminated and recognized. Furthermore, our society values ideas packaged in such a way that they can be used to produce new discoveries and ideas! Perhaps Earth science society needs a much improved wikipedia that can reference other things to develop new ideas? The current research paper approach is rather the opposite. Larry Niven's Kzinti had some kind of visor that organized all research collected by that species. I wish we had something like that! We could call it Psi-Hub !
* "Creativity seems to be "usefully" putting together things which were not perceived to be related before, and it may be *initial psychological* distance between things that counts most" -- Hamming
* This entire book is about improving your creativity, right?
* "What is fundamental partly depends on the individual and their mental makeup" -- Hamming (I need to write my short story about this idea)
* turning over information again and again for more hooks, that sounds like a zettelkasten! I would like to build my own zettelkasten.
* "You must change yourself to be more creative" but Hamming can't tell you how to do that! (One of Shae's tricks is to think about which constraints may change soon, quantum computers might kill off Turing machines as most efficient?)
* P.S. Hamming says changing your habits might help
* Be able to drop a problem or you will be stuck forever!
