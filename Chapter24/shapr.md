# Quantum Mechanics
* everyone is confused forever
* Hamming decided to "represent things in terms of functions they believed would be proper for their field"
* "In the hopes I will thereby, someday, produce a significant insight on their part"
* "You cannot for from a body of data to a unique theory!"
* No one understands why light appears to be both a wave and a particle
* Are there thoughts humans cannot think? Perhaps QM is one of these?
* "Man is not a rational animal, he is a rationalizing animal."
* Spooky action at a distance seems to be real, but cannot be used to communicate at faster than light speed
* Shae wonders: Does it matter that the local speed of light can be changed? Could we use that to improve the speed of communication?
* "Progress is making us face ourselves, computers are central in this process"
