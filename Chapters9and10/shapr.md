# Chapter 9

* Where's the motivation for n-dimensional space being useful?
  This violates [intellectual need](https://mkremins.github.io/blog/doors-headaches-intellectual-need/)
* I wish I had an IHaskell notebook for the math in this chapter.
* What's special about dimension 5? why does it have the greatest relative volume in the unit sphere?
* The four circle surprise is very surprising at ten dimensions, I have to try this myself!
* Why is the L_2 metric obviously sum of squares? I think it's because that's related to multi-dimensional distance?
* I am convinced that things are no longer intuitive at higher dimensions.

# Chapter 10

* Encoding works the same for transmission through time or space!
* Ok, the [McMillan Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft%E2%80%93McMillan_inequality) is neat.
* I wonder if symbol frequency is checked and codes are redesigned in this era?
* Can I use coding theory in URL website design? How could I do that?
* How do I apply Kraft-McMillan to programming language design and spoken language design?
* Is there some relation between uniquely decodable and non-PEG parsers?
* The link above is also for the [Kraft inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft%E2%80%93McMillan_inequality), but I don't understand this one.
* I wish for an interactive visualization of the coding trees and their properties!
