On page 43 about monitors "often called 'the system' these days ... " there is
a discussion about how it takes an outsider, or someone who wonders "why it is
all necessary ... " to find the flaws or inefficiencies in the system. This is
kind of the culmination in my opinion of a lot of elements. I would qualify
them as such:

* Most people fall into one of two groups after a while, either folks who have
	been so frustrated by inability to change the system that they simple don't
	endeavor to understand or improve it anymore, or folks who have no essential
	interest in the system, and are either simply collecting a paycheck, or
	trying to game the system to improve the time-to-paycheck balance. This is
	embodied by the 4-hour work week guy, or the engineers who don't care about
	improving the quality of their work. All the other people either (like
	hamming) learn to work inside the system, and still improve things, or else
	bail out. Only the rare Hamming will actually improve the system rather than
	exclusively trying to pull the lever to get the nibble. Unfortunately,
	newcomers who could also spot systematic drag, are often too untrusted, or
	too busy gaining political footing, to be able to effectively dig at the
	heart of the issue.

* The boiling of water. Most systems degrade overtime without
	serious/thoughtful review. Such reviews can take a lot of forms (burndowns,
	sprint retrospectives, afteractions, etc, etc), but those reviews are not
	enjoyable for engineers. There is another hidden issue, which is that these
	kinds of reviews can actually reveal systematic shortcomings in _the
	management_. Since no one derives immediate personal value from them, and the
	benefit is really to the system, and not any particular players in the
	corporate heirarchy, this practice is seldom implemented in earnest, although
	occasionally implemented in a cargo-cult fashion by recently-trained project
	managers. So, without effective review, the system slowly degrades, until it
	runs at minimum viable effectiveness. The effect is similar to the idea of
	the boiling frog (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog) . However,
	experimentally, frogs will actually hop out of boiling water. Similarly, good
	engineers will depart these teams, which may very well cause them to run
	_below_ minimum viable effectiveness, as the system is already degraded.
	Then, watchout for layoffs!
