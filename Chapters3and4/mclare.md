## Chapter 3

- Didn't get much out of this chapter other than a high level history lesson. I've heard the philosophy before about the machine "does what it does and nothing else (unless it malfunctions)"

## Chapter 4

- I got a lot more out of the last half of this chapter, especially with respect to the discussion about how FORTRAN was for "sissies"! I think there's definitely some high minded "purism" around low level languages as being less accessible/pedestrian.

- Commentary about "think before you write the program". This is pretty universal; I find that far too often not enough time is spent planning as it's dismissed as trivial or unnecessary, which backfires quickly.

- "What is wanted in the long run, of course is that the man with the problem does the actual writing of the code with no human interface... between the person who knows the problem and the person who knows the programming language"
- Working in an engineering field  adjacent that lends itself to programming, one of the worst aspects of academia for me was actually "working" alongside a prestigious CS lab. The CS lab would mine the structural engineers/architects for ideas and then execute the idea in a  paper quickly and abandon the idea. Unsurprisingly this meant that the idea wasn't really fleshed out through actual practical application, and it was pretty demeaning as well (and demoralizing for me, as I was trying to learn at the same time).
