# Chapter 29
* The rating system makes me think about grade deflation -- but also this seems inherently an extrinsic motivation analogy.
* How does his grading system work with the desire that students should master material? Is it only mastery if you can get the trick questions and therefore should be judged accordingly 
* "...grades are closely related to thea bility to carry out a lot of details with high reliability... later the qualities needed to succeed change and it becomes more proving theorems, patterns of reasoning, and the ability to conjecture"
* Issue of "inbreeding" --- definitely confronting this today... nothing has changed
* "If the whole organization is working together to fool the top, there is little the top can do about it"
* Code productivity measured in line... gamification on github about your graph 
# Chapter 30
* "Luck favors the prepared mind" - when will I be ready to make that leap because I'm prepared?
* "Look at your successes and pay less attention to failures than you are usually advised to do in the expression 'Learn from your mistakes'".
* Fame in science is a curse to quality productivity?? - keep at the small problems
* "I strongly recommend taking the time, on a regular basis, to ask the larger questions and not stay immersed in the sea of detail where almost everyone stays almost all the time."
