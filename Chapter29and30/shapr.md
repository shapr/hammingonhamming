# 29 You get what you measure
* For the risky vs conservative measurement systems, how do we compare that to existing rating systems such as university rating systems?
* On measuring training vs education, is there any way to measure education, no matter how poorly? Would that be "general problem solving ability?"
* Clearly IQ is a poor method for measuring general problem solving ability.
* On making exams where you can choose the outcome, is there a good way to make a general purpose exam? Perhaps other teachers would make the exams for your class?
* Tip: use the entire dynamic range when rating things?
* On the fault of ranking giving a poor outcome when the entire class is made up of great people: attend a poorly rated school so you're top of the class?
  I read an article suggesting that was a good strategy, but I forget the link.
* On the subject of specialized but poorly balanced people, all programming interviews seem to reward this practice!
* Original thinkers are not what recruiters find, push the diversity aspect to improve this?
* I like the idea of not employing your own graduates, maybe the same for interns?
* How else to prevent inbreeding in companies?
* The measures use establish habits that will be hard to change later, choose wisely in the beginning! Not that I know how to do that!
