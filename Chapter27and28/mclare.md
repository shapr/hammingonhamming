# Chapter 27 - Unreliable data 
* "Life testing" is a new term for me (but general idea make sense), "life testing" is nearly impossible in the context of buildings and bridge design. We can do chemistry concrete reactions to attempt to speed up degradation but trying to predict the future of how/what we design for has never really happened... which is why infrastructre is so boned in the U.S.
* "If you want to be certain, you are apt to be obsolete" - How then do you design for uncertainty? Conservatism = waste? 
* "We should form a life testing department whose job is to prepare for the testing of the next device which is going to be invented, and not just test after the need arises" - Everyone wants to be proactive, but being proactive is impossible without gobs and gobs of money
* There is never time to do the job right, but there is always time to fix it later.... especially in computer software - not so much elsewhere haha.
* "Long meditation also suggests the present experimental techniques you are taught are also at fault and contribute to the errors in the claimed accuracies."
* "The human animal was not designed to be reliable; it cannot count accurately, it can do little or nothing repetitive with great accuracy" - What can gather better data?
* "You cannot gather a really large amount of data accurately. It is a known fact which is constantly ignored. It is always a matter of limited resources and limited time...small samples carefully taken are better than large samples poorly done."
* Survey generation discussion - bias due to order of operations?
# Chapter 28
* "To rise to the top you should have the larger view -- at least when you get there"
* Hamming's role: "to develop the methods for solving problems, to expand the range of what could be done, and to educate others in what I had found so they could continue, extend, and improve my earlier efforts." -- Isn't this the whole goal of research and science?
* "Usually the effect of the component improvement is less dramatic and clear-cut, but equally detrimental to the performance of the whole system"
* Mathematical induction -- I really need to learn how to do this better...
* "Few people who set out to reform any system try first to find out the total system problem, but rather attack the first symptom they see. And, of course, what emerges is whatever it is, and not what is needed. "
* "Part of systems engineering design is to prepare for changes so they can be gracefully made and still not degrade the other parts"
* "I came to the belief that small problems were relatively more important than large ones; regular, dependable service was a desirable thing."
* "It is one of the functions of the systems engineer to block most of the local optimization of the individuals of the system and reach for the global optimization for the system."
* "But let me say it again, systems engineering must be built on a solid ground of classical simplification to definite problems with definite solutions."
