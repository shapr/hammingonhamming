# Chapter 27 Unreliable data
* [backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html) is the best hard drive testing resource!
  though I remember a story where they found the tricks used to emulate hard lifespan testing selected for drives that worked best under those conditions (hot, dusty, extra vibration)
* End users need ECC RAM in their computers just as much as business customers! Here's thoughts from [Linux Torvalds](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/318832-linus-tovalds-blames-intel-for-killing-ecc-ram-in-consumer-systems) on that subject. Root out unreliable data!
* "There is never time to do the job right, but there is always time to fix it later." This makes sense from the "is the market interested in this product?" approach, but not if you already know this thing needs to be built!
* I guess it's good today's computer hardware is obsolete when shipped, because we don't have to worry about a long lifetime? (Yes, I'm being somewhat sarcastic.)
* The statistician friend story makes me wonder how I can check my work and personal data for inconsistencies.
* Is there a standard suite of statistical tools to check for data errors? Is there any sort of standard approach for finding errors in a data set?
* This reminds me of Dan Luu's [suspicious discontinuities](https://danluu.com/discontinuities/) article, and makes me wonder how I can find those things myself.
* As for inconsistent physical constants, could these be checked against each other somehow? It would also be interesting to check historical values of these constants?
* Hamming's Rule: "90% of the time, the next independent measurement will fall outside the previous 90% confidence limits." Are we even able to take independent measurements as citizen scientists?
* Investopedia suggests the unemployment metric [U-6 is more accurate than U-3](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/true-unemployment-rate-u6-vs-u3.asp) and I agree that U-3 shuffles too many people out of sight. Basically, economic numbers are full of fertilizer.
* In general, Marilyn Strathern's description of [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) applies: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." That is, if the incentive is to report incorrect numbers, you will get incorrect numbers.
* "small samples carefully taken are better than large samples poorly done" I believe this, but am still not sure how to take good samples.
* I don't really understand the flip a coin trick for reporting murders.
