# Chapter 27 Unreliable data
* [backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html) is the best hard drive testing resource!
  though I remember a story where they found the tricks used to emulate hard lifespan testing selected for drives that worked best under those conditions (hot, dusty, extra vibration)
* End users need ECC RAM in their computers just as much as business customers! Here's thoughts from [Linux Torvalds](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/318832-linus-tovalds-blames-intel-for-killing-ecc-ram-in-consumer-systems) on that subject. Root out unreliable data!
* "There is never time to do the job right, but there is always time to fix it later." This makes sense from the "is the market interested in this product?" approach, but not if you already know this thing needs to be built!
* I guess it's good today's computer hardware is obsolete when shipped, because we don't have to worry about a long lifetime? (Yes, I'm being somewhat sarcastic.)
* The statistician friend story makes me wonder how I can check my work and personal data for inconsistencies.
* Is there a standard suite of statistical tools to check for data errors? Is there any sort of standard approach for finding errors in a data set?
* This reminds me of Dan Luu's [suspicious discontinuities](https://danluu.com/discontinuities/) article, and makes me wonder how I can find those things myself.
* As for inconsistent physical constants, could these be checked against each other somehow? It would also be interesting to check historical values of these constants?
* Hamming's Rule: "90% of the time, the next independent measurement will fall outside the previous 90% confidence limits." Are we even able to take independent measurements as citizen scientists?
* Investopedia suggests the unemployment metric [U-6 is more accurate than U-3](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/true-unemployment-rate-u6-vs-u3.asp) and I agree that U-3 shuffles too many people out of sight. Basically, economic numbers are full of fertilizer.
* In general, Marilyn Strathern's description of [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) applies: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." That is, if the incentive is to report incorrect numbers, you will get incorrect numbers.
* "small samples carefully taken are better than large samples poorly done" I believe this, but am still not sure how to take good samples.
* I don't really understand the flip a coin trick for reporting murders.

# Chapter 28 Systems Engineering
* "there is no single larger picture" I agree with that!
* The "important computing" paragraph describes my process of going from "write good programs" to "teach people how to write their own programs".
* "If you optimize your components, you will probably ruin the system performance."
* I really like this story about 'pass the test at the end of two years' and I approached my university classes as a way to ignore grades and ingest as much knowledge as possible. All the students I know work towards the highest GPA; yet again, the incentive is wrong.
* I wish math courses were taught with real world applicability as the most important goal, I would take math classes ALL THE TIME! I've heard good things about [street fighting mathematics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/street-fighting-mathematics) but haven't read it!
* Action Item for Shae: come up with a list of systems I use but don't understand as a whole, and see what I can figure out. (I don't understand enough Haskell!)
* "Part of systems engineering design is to prepare for changes so they can be gracefully made and still not degrade the other parts." hm, yeah!
* The goal of the system is to prepare you for your future!
* "The closer you meet the specifications, the worse the performance will be when overloaded" I bet mclare could talk about this in bridges and buildings!
* "good design includes the graceful decay of performance when the specifications are exceeded"
* 'One Man's Systems Engineering' by H.R. Westerman is unfindable, but a 2002 book by the same author can be found for $225. I need to find these essays!
* Westerman believes specialists must do their normal everday job between being on a systems engineering team. I believe this applies to instructors, they must be doing the job in order to understand what they need to teach. That still doesn't mean they'll be good teachers though!
* "One of the functions of a systems engineer is to block local optimizations and reach for global optimization of the system" What's the opposite of this, maybe a politician?
* Westerman believes the client does not understand the causes of the problem, my seven years self-employed agree with that. My mantra was "The client only knows what they want when you don't give it to them." My most productive approach was to create a minimal prototype as quickly as possible, so the client could gain a better understanding of their actual needs. My role was to be a foil to the protagonist, and hopefully the most effective foil possible!
* "A solution that which does not prepare for the next round with some increased insight is hardly a solution at all." This is my primary complaint with machine learning! IT DOES NOT INCREASE INSIGHT!
* How could schools teach systems engineering? "The new element is the /formulation/ of a definition problem from the background of indefiniteness which is the basis of our society."
* Westerman says old hands must be gradually removed from a team and new people brought on. My employer does not do this and it's causing problems. I wish for regular consistent team migration at every job, but that's the opposite of what I've seen. Perhaps I need to be the change I want to see?

I still have many more thoughts floating around in my head on this topic.
