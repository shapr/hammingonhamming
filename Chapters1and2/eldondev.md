# Commentary from the reading of Chapters 1 and 2

In the analogy with painting and styles, there is a discussion of "studying under masters."
Who are the masters of given styles today?

Hamming lists "recreation" under "Personnel Problems"

"The more complex the designed system, the more central field maintenance must be to the final design"

Hamming suggests that upper management seems rarely _if ever_ able to avoid the increasing availability
of fine-grained scrutiny. The output of this seems often to be failure demand, and bikeshedding.

Failure demand is a topic discussed here: https://codahale.com/work-is-work/ , bikeshedding everyone knows.

I wonder if this gets back to an idea I heard recently, that the most effective software teams were the size
of jazz bands. Having companies that are approximately jazz-band sized, the metaphor could be extended to include the sound
engineer (UX folks), the manager/booking agent (CEO), and the swag-seller (sales? ;) I find this very appealing,
and often reminisce about the days of working in companies closer to this size.
