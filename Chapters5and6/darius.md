# Chapter 5
* So before reading on, I stopped to consider what'd be a good topic for his talk, and "Plenty of room at the bottom" came to mind. His actual topic was not so very different.
* p. 36 *Why* do S-curves so often add up to steady exponentials?
* Right now there's lots of runway for digital control of things to become a bigger deal still. I think it'll be even more central.
* p. 37 scattered associations: "seeing like a state", agorics, blockchains
* p. 38 these hangups of custom chips come from the Dennard scaling era; how strongly do they still apply?

# Chapter 6
* "information": how about, the quality of things that implies a model ought to be updated; where a 'model' is any machine that's just as functional in alternative realizations, because it's the pattern that matters?
* The critique of expert systems is reasonable; it doesn't account for the at-the-time newer approach based on probability (e.g. Judea Pearl)
* p. 41 nowadays the central take on AI is of the science/engineering of rational agents
* p. 42 the Turing test seeing something you can reasonably call success is not so far off, I think. In noninteractive settings you could say it's already happened (GPT-3).
* "in his own image" recursively implies subcreation
* He was surely right that if you weren't taking AI seriously then you'd face big surprises over the course of your career
